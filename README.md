# Canva Extension

This README contains two sections, **Canva Select** and **Canva Download**, each with their own content.

<!-- Tab Links -->
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly; margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <a href="#canva-select" style="padding: 10px; background-color: #007bff; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px;">Canva Select</a>
  <a href="#canva-download" style="padding: 10px; background-color: #28a745; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px;">Canva Download</a>
</div>

## <a id="canva-select"></a> Canva Select

Here is the content for the **Canva Select** section. You can replace this with any HTML or markdown content you'd like.

```html
<div>
  <h2>Welcome to Canva Select</h2>
  <p>This section is about selecting content in Canva. You can add any information about selection options here.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Welcome to Canva Download</h2>
  <p>This section focuses on downloading content from Canva. Describe the download process or features here.</p>
</div>


### Explanation:
- **HTML inside Markdown**: GitHub allows HTML tags inside Markdown, so we’re using `<div>`, `<a>`, and other HTML elements to mimic tabs.
- **Link-based Navigation**: The links at the top act as "tabs" that jump to their respective sections using `#canva-select` and `#canva-download`.
- **Style in Links**: The `style` attribute in the links adds some visual styling for the tabs (such as background colors and padding).

### Limitations:
- GitHub’s Markdown renderer doesn’t allow for true interactive tabs like in a website.
- This is a simple, link-based solution that mimics tabs by jumping to sections.

### Result:
When you view this `README.md` file on GitHub, you’ll see two clickable "tabs" at the top that link to their respective sections below.
